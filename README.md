# Project-Customer-Life-Time-Value-Analysis
Project: E-commerce Customer Analysis and Metrics

I conducted a detailed E-commerce customer analysis using Python and Pandas, focusing on key features like 'total_revenue' and 'age'. Ensured data accuracy through meticulous cleaning and precise date conversion. Employed Seaborn for insightful data visualizations.

Calculated vital metrics such as Average Order Value (AOV), Purchase Frequency, Repeat Rate, Churn Rate, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV). AOV revealed typical spending behaviour, while Purchase Frequency indicated customer transaction frequency. Repeat Rate and Churn Rate provided insights into customer retention.

The highlight was determining CLTV, offering a comprehensive view of a customer's long-term value. These insights guide strategic decision-making and optimize marketing strategies for sustainable business growth.
